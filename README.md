## Introduction
In the past few years, in the field of computer vision,**Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs)** have developed rapidly, especially in the image classification task. This project is based on the recent computer vision top conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV) and other excellent papers. Various types of convolutional neural networks are implemented on the framework of**Pytorch**. Some models have special training, regularization, test mode, etc., because the authors of the paper are more brief, and because the author of this project is relatively simple, there may be minor problems. It is proposed that the project will continue to be updated.
